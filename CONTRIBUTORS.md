# Contributing
## Steps before creating a pull request.
1. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
2. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!

## New Concepts
Always consult the leader of the project before introducing new concepts.

## C# Style
- Private variables should start with a `_` and be camelCase.
- Public variables should follow the PascalFormat
- Methods should follow PascalFormat
- Local variables do not need a `_` and should be camelCase.

### General Guidelines for Style
- Do not remove informative comments.
- Keep the indentation as is, do not expand something if it's compressed.
- Try to follow the general style the owner has laid down throughout all of the code.
