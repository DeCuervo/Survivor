# Survivor
## About
A 2D Unity Game with a current heavy focus on a job management system. Workers collect resources and bring them back to the base. The player will start off with a colony of their own aside many other colonies foe, neutral or ally. They will be able to manage colonists jobs and control their movement manually if they want.

There are future plans for enemy AI, combat mechanics, world fog mechanics, procedural world generation, walking mechs / vehicles, more structures such as barracks / research labs / storage buildings, economy systems, trade routes, and potentially multiplayer support.
