## C# Style & Guidelines
- Private variables should be camelCase.
- Public variables should follow the PascalFormat
- Methods should follow PascalFormat
- Do not remove informative comments.
- Keep the indentation as is, do not expand something if it's compressed.
- Try to follow the general style the owner has laid down throughout all of the code.

## Animations
### Mixamo Humanoids
Keep the format .FBX for Unity at 30 Frames with no keyframe reduction and check off "In Place" if applicable. Import the .FBX into Blender, then delete the imported armature. Apply the new animation to the original armature. Make sure your applying the animation to the "Armature" and not the "Cube". Export the Blender file to .FBX, import into Unity, set the scale factor to 0.1, set the animation type to Humanoid, go into configure, sample Bind-Pose, then enforce T-Pose, and finally enable Loop Time for all animations.
